##### Types of notation
-	Big-$\Theta$ *(Big Theta)* - *Tight bound*
	-	Shows the upper and lower running time
-	Big-O *(Big O)* - *Upper bound*
	-	Gives the upper running time
-	Big-$\Omega$ *(Big Omega)* - *Lower bound*
	-	Gives the lower running time



##### Types of fucntions in order of growth speed

1.  Constant functions - *A constant number*
2.  Logarithmic functions - *Functions with a log*
3.  Linear functions - *Simple multiplication*
4.  Linearithmic functions - *Functions with a log multiplied by n*
5.  Polynomial functions - *With a constant exponent*
6.  Exponential functions - *Has an increasing exponent*
